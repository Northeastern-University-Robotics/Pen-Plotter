            Before utilizing motors, make sure to wait using the waitUntilReady() function.
            
            The Moteus class will do a few things on startup.
                - Check all CAN ports for valid connections as described
                    - If there is one error, a MoteusException will be raised. It will then enter simulation mode (described below) if the parameter is True
                - Initialize all motor positions to the current value on the motor. Therefore, if the class was restarted but the motors were not, the position remains the same.
                - Wait until all motors are ready. This will BLOCK code, make sure to accomodate accordingly. This is only done once on startup.
            @param ids These are the CAN ids of the motors attached to the Pi3Hat.
                        Is a list of lists, with each internal list representing the IDs of the motors attatched to that can drive
                        For example, [[],[],[4]] means that on CAN bus 3, there is 1 motor with ID 4 attatched.
                        - All of these IDs must be unique, regardless if they are on the same CAN bus or not.
            @param simulation (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) This parameter, default True, will bring the class into simulation mode if an error arises on startup
                                Simulation mode will mimic all values set as if there were a motor present, therefore, code can be tested without being connected to hardware
