    Provides a ROS interface to the Moteus motor hardware

    The RaspberryPiMoteusWrapper is an adaptor which transforms
    incoming sensor data from the Moteus motor hardware into
    ROS messages (as the Moteus interface is incompatible with ROS).

    You specify the configuration of each motor that is in control
    by supplying a 'MoteusMotorDescriptor' for each of the motors

    Each instance of the RaspberryPiMoteusWrapper services a
    fixed number of motors; you cannot change the number
    (or names) of the motors that are serviced by each instance.
    Instead, create a new instance of the class and replace the
    old instance to add more motors

    NOTE: The class is intended to function as a singleton, as
    each instance serves as a publisher to the 'current_orientation' topic.

    NOTE: This class is not thread-safe. You must ensure that concurrent
    accesses are properly synchronized

    Attributes
    ----------

    id_map : { int : int }
